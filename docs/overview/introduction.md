![4 design key ingredients for Docq](../assets/Docq_design_key_ingredients.png)

## Docq is designed for businesses serious about adopting AI

Unlike many recent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings utilising the latest innovation in AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), Docq has the clear goal of helping businesses adopt AI from the very beginning.

In our view, this is as much of a technology challenge such as running the system privately and securely, but also an organisational challenge where businesses today have much to gain such as in productivity while at the same time, equally much to lose without careful planning.

To anticipate the challenges ahead, we think there are a few key ingredients for any solution to be successfully adopted:

- **Utilising private, organisational data**: There is untapped potential for any business with their operational knowledge encoded in the data.
- **Addressing data security and privacy concerns**: No business would send their customer details, revenue figures or even trade secrets to any un-vetted 3rd-parties; But this is exactly what could happen when an employee have uncontrolled access to AI products such as ChatGPT (and it has happened).
- **Justifying ROI quickly and clearly**: The latest innovation in AI/LLMs has caught worldwide attention and we agree that for businesses it has not only immediate use cases but also huge potential. The key for any software in the space in a business environment is to help smooth out the adoption curve.
- **Supporting in the long run**: We are only starting to see the potential of the technologies; Any software in commercial use should be developed with a long-term roadmap and supported by experts in the space.
