Docq helps your _**businesses**_ gain _**AI-based knowledge insight**_ from your _**private data, securely!**_

Think of Docq as **your employees' private and secure ChatGPT, a second-brain that understands your business**.

Docq is Open Source Software (OSS AGPLv3) that is self-hosted "on-premises" within your cloud provider account (Azure/AWS/GCP). That means all systems, including machine learning models and data, lives within your boundary of control.

For the developers and other tech-savvy audience, Docq is like **WordPress for generative AI**. Out-of-the-box you get a private ChatGPT and a platform that can be customised and built upon using a plugin system (see [extensions](./developer-guide/extensions.md)) and APIs (coming soon).
